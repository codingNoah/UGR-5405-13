            <h1>Ever Hills Hotel</h1>
            <p>
              Ever Hills is located in Bole, just a 20-minute walk from the Bole
              International AirLines. Built in 2022 it has old school charm and
              many rooms still feature high, crown-molded ceilings. A 2012
              renovation brought all rooms and services up to modern day scratch
              and guestrooms come equipped with free Wi-Fi and all the usual
              amenities required for a comfortable stay. Program Leader
              Evaluations: “This is a great location. Good service and nice
              breakfast.”

            <h1>Dining Tables</h1>
            <p>
              At Ever Hills, we’re serving up more than 40 types of foods. In
              fact, Ever Hills Famous on local Foods, Shiro is one of our
              unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the
              day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers
              high. Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than
              one year, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and
              roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before
              it’s topped with Ever Hills signature herb-garlic butter, then
              carved tableside.
