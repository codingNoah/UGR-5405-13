            Ethiopia has much to offer to international tourists. It has a
            unique historical and cultural heritage, magnificent scenery, a
            surprisingly cool climate, rich flora and fauna, important
            archaeological sites and hospitable people. The northern tourist
            circuit known as the “Historic Route’’ comprises the most important
            tourist sites in the country. The country is a strategically located
            in the Horn of Africa and therefore, many international meetings and
            conferences are held in Ethiopia. This creates a huge demand for
            accommodation at an international standard and even an increase in
            such a demand is expected in the future because the importance of
            Ethiopia in Africa has been growing and as a result, many
            international organizations have been continuously strengthening
            their institutions and augmenting their personnel in Ethiopia. A
            relative increase of investment is recently observed in the hotel
            and tourism sector.
